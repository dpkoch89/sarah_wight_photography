	<h4 id="location">Choosing a Location</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>If you already have a location in mind, great! Let me know where it is so I can check it out in advance. Please note that locations out of the Salt Lake and Utah Counties will include a travel fee.</li>
		<li>Not sure where you want the pictures done? No problem! Let me know what feel you're going for with your photos. Do you want edgy and urban? Or organic and earthy? High fashion and classy? Once we've established the style, I can send you a list of locations that would work, and we can choose from those.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 id="clothing">Clothing Tips</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Avoid words and graphics on clothing.</li>
		<li>It's always a good idea to color-coordinate.</li>
		<li>If they're engagement or family photos, avoid clashing patterns.</li>
		<li>Call or email me if you have any specific clothing questions.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 id="makeup">Makeup</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>While I do re-touching on all ordered photos, makeup can go a long way to improve your photos. Be sure to bring some lipgloss or chapstick along, as lips tend to dry out halfway through the session.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 id="get_to_know_you">Help Me Get to Know You</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>It's always good for me to get to know you a bit before the shoot. This helps me create the most accurate representation of you possible. Send me an email telling me a little bit about you! What are your interests? What do you like to do? What's your style? What's something weird about you??</li>

	<ul>
		<li>I'll  meet you at the location we've decided upon, and we'll shoot for 1-2 hours. All packages include unlimited wardrobe changes. We'll do a variety of poses to make sure you have plenty of looks to choose from. Feel free to bring along friends or family members! I'll likely have an assistant with me to help out with lighting and other technical stuff.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>Once I've gone through all the photos and selected all the very best ones, I'll upload them to my proofing site. It generally takes 1-3 days. I'll give you a password so you can access your private album. Here you can star your favorites and order prints. You'll need to pay online with a credit card. These prints are high quality professional prints- much better than what you'd get at Walmart. These are prints worth going on the wall or in the album. I have canvas prints and custom-designed albums available. Once you've completed your order, they'll be printed and shipped to you! If you ordered a CD, that will also be shipped to you. You'll be able to make prints from this as well, but I recommend taking it to a professional lab. Make sure you order everything before your online gallery expires. Of course I'll still have the photos if you need them later, but I take them off to make room for other photos on my site.</li>
		<li>If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to contact me! I'm always willing to work with you.</li>
